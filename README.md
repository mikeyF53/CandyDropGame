*Add drawing*


## Main
A candy dropper will move left and right at an certain speed interval. Pressing the spacebar and a mouseclick will release a candy. The goal is to drop it into the bottom opening without touching the walls. Each candy collected will give you one point. Every 5 levels will increase the speed of the Candy Dropper. You will have 10 lives per game, game is over when you lose all lives.

## Technologies
Pressing the space bar will move the block, "candy", down. It needs to be timed correctly so it wont hit the wall. Pr

## Obstacles
Setting the collision detection on the walls will be a challenge for me. Dropping a piece of block down repeatedly after points is scored or a life is lost.


## Solutions
I plan on creating this game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I will have to figure out how to set a detection of the candy hitting the wall when the drop is not timed correctly.
