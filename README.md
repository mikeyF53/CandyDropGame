# Project 1 Mike Fang Candy Drop

# Title


## Instructions

Objective of this game is to carefully time the movement of the candy dropper in to the candy collector.

## Wireframe
See drawing.




## Main
A candy dropper will move left and right at an certain speed interval. Pressing the spacebar will release the candy and drop it. The goal is to drop it into the candy collector without touching the sides. Each candy collected will advance a level. Each level will increase the movement speed of the candy dropper. Each session will have 5 lives, game is over when you lose all lives. The player wins when they have caught 10 pieces of candy.

## Technologies
Pressing the space bar will move the block, "candy", down. It needs to be timed correctly so it wont hit the wall. Pr

## Obstacles
Setting the collision detection on the walls will be a challenge for me. Dropping a piece of block down repeatedly after points is scored or a life is lost.


## Solutions
I plan on creating this game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

I will have to figure out how to set a detection of the candy hitting the wall when the drop is not timed correctly.
